## Azure CLI (Local Development on OSX)

Ensure Azure CLI is installed

OSX

```sh
brew update && brew install azure-cli
```

## Azure - Service User

This will be used in the Fly.io deployment (or other hosting service)
The steps below walks you through creating a service user (Service Principal) in Azure and collecting the necessary credentials for automation, scripting, or integration purposes.

## ✅ Step 1: Register an App in Microsoft Entra ID

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Navigate to: **Microsoft Entra ID** > **App registrations**
3. Click **+ New registration**
4. Fill in the form:
   - **Name**: `my-service-user`
   - **Supported account types**: _Accounts in this organizational directory only (Default)_
   - **Redirect URI**: _(Optional)_ Leave blank unless needed
5. Click **Register**

📌 **Save these values from the Overview page:**

- `CLIENT_ID` = **Application (client) ID**
- `TENANT_ID` = **Directory (tenant) ID**

## ✅ Step 2: Create a Client Secret

1. After registration, go to **Certificates & secrets**
2. Click **+ New client secret**
3. Enter a description and choose an expiry (e.g., 6 months, 12 months)
4. Click **Add**
5. **Copy the generated secret value immediately**

📌 Save this value:

- `CLIENT_SECRET` = _The generated secret value_

> ⚠️ You will not be able to retrieve the secret again after leaving the page.

## ✅ Step 3: Assign the Service Principal Access to Azure Resources

1. Go to **Subscriptions**
2. Select your target **Subscription**
3. Click **Access control (IAM)** > **+ Add > Add role assignment**
4. In the **Role** tab, select a roles `Azure AI User` and `Cognitive Services Contributor`

   - Select it and click **Review + assign**

## ✅ Step 4: Get Your Subscription ID

1. Go to **Subscriptions**
2. Select your active subscription
3. Copy the **Subscription ID** from the overview pane

📌 Save this value:

- `SUBSCRIPTION_ID` = _The Subscription's GUID_

## Deploying to Fly.io

1. `fly launch` to launch a new app with Fly
2. copy all the `.env` configuration to respective `[env]` variables in `fly.toml`
3. copy secrets to `.env.flysecrets`
4. import the secrets using `fly secrets import < ./.env.flysecrets`

# Populating Demo Data

Once the application has been deployed (or before running locally) ensure that the Twilio Sync objects are populated by running the script:
`pnpm run data:populate`
